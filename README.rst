This is a Python package for linear autonomous pool models.
It provides a class LinearAutonomousPoolModels that allows 
computation of transit time, system age, and pool ages.

Since transit time and system age are phase-type distributed, the computations of them
rely on properties of this distribution. They are treated in a separate module.
