Description: This is a Python package for linear autonomous pool models.
        It provides a class LinearAutonomousPoolModel that allows 
        computation of transit time, system age, and pool ages.
        
        Since transit time and system age are phase-type distributed, the computations of them
        rely on properties of this distribution. They are treated in a separate module.
